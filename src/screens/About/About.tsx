          RNR has developed over the last decade into one of the finest British
          chauffeur companies, and has become a name synonymous within the
          industry for professionalism, refinement and luxury. RNR was founded
          in 2005, by the late Andrew Senior along with his son Will, and later
          on was joined by his eldest son Richard. Starting with just two
          vehicles and a handful of exclusive clientele, today there are over
          250 professional chauffeurs who drive some of the most important and
          influential people on the globe.
          <br />
          <br />
          Andrew Seniorâ€™s founding principles of quality, authenticity and
          innovation, over his 20 years in the industry, are still of the utmost
          importance today. His son Will Senior has now taken these early
          principles and moved them forward. Our aim is, and always was, to
          redefine luxury travel.
