            RNR has developed over the last decade into one of the finest
            British chauffeur companies, and has become a name synonymous within
            the industry for professionalism, refinement and luxury. RNR was
            founded in 2005, by the late Andrew Senior along with his son Will,
            and later on was joined by his eldest son Richard. Starting with
            just two vehicles and a handful of exclusive clientele, today there
            are over 250 professional chauffeurs who drive some of the most
            important and influential people on the globe.
          <br />
          <br />
            Andrew Seniorâ€™s founding principles of quality, authenticity and
            innovation, over his 20 years in the industry, are still of the
            utmost importance today. His son Will Senior has now taken these
            early principles and moved them forward. Our aim is, and always was,
            to redefine luxury travel.
